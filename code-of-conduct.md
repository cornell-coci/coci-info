# Code of Conduct
You're likely an employee at Cornell.  If so, read the HR rules and act accordingly.  We will fully cooperate with Cornell HR and CUPD if neccessary.  Be cool and we ain't got problems.

If you're not an employee at Cornell, follow the don't be a jerk code of conduct.  If you want a reference, try https://bento-starter.netlify.com/code-of-conduct/.  The organizers here are not HR people and banning problematic people is faster and legally safer for us than trying to work through your crap.  Act accordingly.
Explicitly our standards are:
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

    Using welcoming and inclusive language
    Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
    Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
    Focusing on what is best for the community
    Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
    Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    Public or private harassment
    Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

If Cornell policy is more strict, this community will abide by those.  Complaints should be sent to a member of this group's leadership or directly to Cornell HR or both.  If sent to leadership, our default will be to escalate directly to Cornell HR.  You may request that we don't, but that's going to be hard for us to figure out how to handle the situation.  Clear violations of the CoC will result in banning with no warning.  Continuing an offending behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment and a clear violation of the CoC.  Unclear violations result in one warning.  Further violations of the same nature result in banning.  Freedom of speech doesn't mean we're your platform for harassment.

Additionally you are expected to follow these standards:
 - Be present
 - Take risks
 - Take space – make space
 - Use the past, abandon it if it doesn’t work
 - Open mind
 - Appreciate structure and break out
 - Creative liberty
 - Confidentiality
 - Real stories/examples
 - Be willing to be vulnerable
 - Feedback should be constructive
 - Speak freely and listen patiently
 - Listen to understand reply
 - No dumb ideas
 - Humor
